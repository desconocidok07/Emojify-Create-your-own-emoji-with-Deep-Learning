This project uses deep learning to classify facial expressions and map them to corresponding emojis or avatars. It uses the FER2013 dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

Technologies:
1.Languages: Python
2.Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras
3.Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib

How It Works:
1.Preprocessing: Normalizes and resizes facial images.
2.CNN Training: Classifies emotions using FER2013 dataset.
3.Emoji Mapping: Links classified emotions to emojis/avatars.
